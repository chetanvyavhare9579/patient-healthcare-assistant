# patient-healthcare-assistant
An AI-inspired console-based Patient Health Assistant to admit patients, monitor vitals, track medicines, and guide doctors with risk analysis.
# 🏥 Patient Health Assistant System

The **Patient Health Assistant** is a Python-based console project designed to simulate how AI can support healthcare workflows in hospitals.  
It helps doctors and staff admit patients, record medical history, monitor vital signs, track medicines, and even notify doctors when a patient is at risk.  

This project demonstrates that **AI does not replace humans** – it **assists and augments** their decision-making.  
Humans think and design, while AI helps to **implement and automate**.
